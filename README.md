# AdvML-style-transfer
Our code consists of two parts: artistic style transfer and transformation network. Each part is able to run independently. All codes are stored in a folder named 'code', and input images are put in 'input_images'. The main functions are written in .ipynb. If you ran the code on google colab, please upload all moduals(.py) to the same work directory and upload images to appropriate folders.
